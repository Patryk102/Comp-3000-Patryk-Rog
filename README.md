## Project Vision
For restaurant owners and customers looking for restaurants
Whose need an efficient way to manage reservations and orders and customers need a way of booking a table.
The Restaurant table booking system
Is a system which allows customers to book a table at a restaurant and then order food at different restaurants and have it delivered to their table, the restaurant owners on the other hand get a way of managing reservations and orders.
Unlike other restaurants apps or food ordering apps
Our product offers a single app which can be used book tables at multiple restaurants and a system which allows restaurant owners to see the reservations. The application will work as a web app which can be opened in the browser for restaurant owners and then customers can order using a mobile app on their phones.
As an extra the application may also support ordering food and having it delivered to the table but the core is the table booking system for multiple restaurants.
